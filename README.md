1.0 Project design

This phase of project design is meant to provide a plan of how the proposed solution can be used to solve the problem that was identified earlier. In this section, we seek to identify how different modules can be integrated into the system. We will also demonstrate how each module interacts with one another to produce the result. The overall purpose of project design is to define how the modules, components, data and interfaces justify the specified requirements (Leveson & Weiss, 2009). This section is usually split into two-stages which include the database design using the Access and the physical design. Below is the explanation of the two stages of process design.
1.1 Physical design

The physical design refers to a graphical representation that shows how the system works. This section specifies how the main components i.e. internal, external are applied. Internal entities refer to entities that are found within the system that transforms the data internally (Wasserman, 2010). 
2.0 Project implementation

Implementation of this project is an organization process that is carried out in the respective user community. The specific user community that is best served by this clinical management system is in the entire health care arena. These are composed of a group of users which include nurses, doctors, physicians, managers and even researchers. All these parties have relevant skills, expertise and knowledge of how to interact and use this system. Each of the users mentioned above has a different expectation of how to interpret and use the system.
The implantation of this project is not fully done and but can be accessed online. The basic model for implementing this project is a client-server scenario. As such, the SQL server will need to be installed in a server machine. Clients, in this case, refer to a different computer that will be used by different users to access the server (Goodyear, 2017). To access the server, the client will need to have software that will be developed and programmed using C#. Every client from their respective remote locations will make a connection to the server using either server name or IP address.
Additionally, during the implementation of this system, we will ensure that each client will need to login to the system before he or she makes any action. We haven’t created the login module but in order to do it you need to create it the same. The login module will require one to select the type of user based on the actors that were mentioned earlier and later input the login ID and the corresponding password. Once the user has logged on to the system, the window will display different services and actions that can be taken. Each user can perform any activity or process depending on the privileges that he or she is given.
3.0 Project testing and Results

Once the system has been developed and is thought to be complete, the next step would be to test it. It is important to test a system before it is officially launched to verify the accuracy of the system (Lewis, 2017). Testing of the system is an official step that involves a sequence of various testing. The clients and the intended users will be hoping to get a reliably functional system. During the development of a system, there are instances where the application may contain defects that might have occurred during the development phase. If these defects are not identified early enough the defects may go along and may be a challenge to the system users. Of proper testing is done to the system before it is launched, then there will be a delivery of high-quality products. There are several levels of testing that can be done to a system. Below are some of the level of testing that were carried out on the clinical management system.

3.1 Unit Testing

Unit testing is a type of testing that is done to each specific unit of the system (Naik & Tripathy, 2011). This is done to ensure that each of the modules in the system is working smoothly and executes in a way that does not produce errors. Unit testing is usually done by the programmer on each of the parts of the system which include procedures, function or even modules. We were able to test each unit periodically especially after each code has been successfully written for the design. This was enhanced by the debugger. The compiler that we used to write the code. Each of the error that resulted from this process was corrected before we proceeded to build another unit. Like the different web pages that are crated the data validation upon the entering it to the different fields in the pages where it always looks for the correct data type.
3.2 Validation Testing

Validation testing is a type of testing which is done to test if the system can handle wrong data that might be fed into the system (Lewis, 2017). Additionally, it validates the data that is entered by the system user to ensure that the data is in the correct format and is in the correct data type. For this type of testing, we had specified the type of data that would be fed into the system during database design section. For example, we had specified the data type of grand total as double. Therefore, if a user feeds in the data that is either variable or character, the system will validate and return an error message. This type of testing is important since if wrong data is entered into the system, it may result in a system error which will mislead the whole system.
3.3 System and User Acceptance Testing

This is the final type of testing that is done to a complete system. After all the units and modules have been tested, the last step is to test the overall system. Overall system testing is done after each of the unit has been integrated (Naik & Tripathy, 2011). The overall system is tested before it is finally released to the users and the clients. After the system has been tested by developers, the next step would be user acceptance testing. This type of testing is not done by the developers but would be done by the specific users who will use the system (Lewis, 2017). In this type of testing, we involved doctors and medical practitioners from a certain clinic. The medical practitioners who were involved in the testing of the system appreciated our work and gave positive feedback.
4.0 Recommendations for Future Enhancements

From the comments and feedback that we received from the implementation of this system, it was evident that this system was would have a positive impact on the entire medical field. The implementation of this project would see the targeted medical field automate most of their services. The system efficient and a reliable way of managing clinical records. The result of this efficiency is that there would be increased performance, practices and an increase in the overall productivity in the health center.
Going forward, the clinics that will implement this system will be required to use this system in a professional way. The respective clinic’s will be required to use and maintain the system to ensure that they gather maximum output from the system. One thing that they will need to do is to ensure that they carry out regular backups for all the data and files. This will ensure that the organization maintains data in quality and in a secure way. Additionally, the clinic’s will be required to design their network to ensure that the movement of information and files within the organization is done efficiently.
